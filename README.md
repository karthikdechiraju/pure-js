# pure-js
This is just a sample project I am doing using only javascript and no backend. This is my attempt to break long sessions of coding to relieve stresss. It automatically open every one two hours and asks me to play and relax.  A game like Mario or a temple run. Just used a sample characters. I am trying to concentrate more on game play. Its under construction.
